DeskSlot

Overview:
The â€œDeskSlot Booking System'' is an application . My project is designed to nullify the difficulty facing by students in searching for vacant and working computer systems after the college timings. So my project is confined only to our college.This application  facilitates students to book and manage desk spaces in a shared computer lab and library environments. This application provides a streamlined approach to workspace utilization, allowing users to reserve specific desk spaces for designated periods. This abstraction enhances efficiency by ensuring optimal resource allocation, minimizing time wastage, and fostering a structured work environment.
